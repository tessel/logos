# Tessel Logos

**Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/tessel/logos/releases)** to directly download SVG, 200px PNG, and 1000px PNG versions of these logos. You can also download the `1-tessel-logos.tar.gz` archive of all these generated versions.

This repository contains all Tessel and module logos in their original .ai source formats. The `Makefile` converts these programmatically into various image formats.

## Generating .svg and .png manually

You can generate SVG and PNG assets from the command line, by installing a few conversion tools.

On OS X, install these through brew:

```
brew install optipng pdf2svg gs librsvg
```

To run the conversion, simply run make:

```
make
```

Images will result in the `generated/` folder.
