# Tessel Logos

All Tessel and module logos are provided here in their original .ai source formats.

To download SVGs, 200px PNGs, and 1000px PNGS, download `1-tessel-logos.tar.gz` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/tessel/logos/releases).

## Generating .svg and .png manually

You can generate SVG and PNG assets from the command line, by installing a few conversion tools.

On OS X, install these through brew:

```
brew install optipng pdf2svg imagemagick gs
```

To run the conversion, simply run make:

```
make
```

Images will result in the `generated/` folder.
